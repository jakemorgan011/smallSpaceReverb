# smallSpaceReverb
emulated reflections in a small space chamber.

# most recent additions
- it works??? i guess.
- the plugin doesn't crash computers anymore

# problems: 

- extreme clipping on lauch
- no tails in the reverb.
- not all allpass filters are behaving properly. but still sounds interesting.
- dry wet knob is not working since the final process of audio is in a subclass and the value of the dry wet knob is not a static variable.
- no UI at the moment but that will come soon.
